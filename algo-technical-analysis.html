            <h1> Why go technical? </h1>
            <p> There are three main approaches one could adopt to forecast prices and
                subsequently trade in the market.<br>
                - The first is fundamental analysis, where one attempts to identify the
                intrinsic value of the investment through analysis of past company
                financials (or commodity demand). It is not always straightforward
                to interpret these numbers however, and a fair amount of educated
                guesswork is required to predict revenues over future years.<br>
                - The second is technical analysis, where one attempts to predict
                market dynamics based on past historic price patterns. One could
                take this a step further by applying more rigorous mathematical
                analysis on historical data, including assessing technical analysis
                approaches and their performance - that is through quantitative
                analysis. The key assumption however is that past price movements
                may be indicative of future prices movements.<br>
                - Finally, one may follow publicly available information and news to
                form an idea about how the market is expected to move. However,
                getting to the news first is critical to realising profits
                reliable, something that can be hard to do.<br>
            </p>

            <div class='mark'>
                Technical analysis attempts to identify entry and exit points
                in the market and form an expectation on price movements,
                but with no concern as to why.<br>
                Analysis may be directly performed based on historic data
                time-series (e.g. OHLC, volume and other data) and to a certain
                degree in an automated manner.
            </div>

            <p> The reasoning behind technical analysis is that there are
                inefficiencies which do not allow the market to perfectly discount
                available information about an asset's value. For example, there
                might be some insider activity that could start affecting an asset's
                price even before news break out. Furthermore, even when all news
                become available not all market participants will act at the same
                moment or in the same way.<br>
                Furthermore, to a large extent these inefficiencies are a result
                of market participants psychology. The patterns and points that
                technical analysis identifies are expected to appear time and
                again as exactly due to this reason.

            <h2> Trends & the Dow theory </h2>
            <p> Technical analysis has its origins on the Dow theory. The latter
                assumes that:<br>
                - The averages (market trend) will eventually discount everything.<br>
                - There are three key trends in the market: a primary one which can
                last months to years; a secondary reaction which lasts weeks to
                months; and minor trends which last days to weeks.<br>
                - Primary trends have three phases: accumulation where informed
                participants buy more of the asset while others being bearish sell;
                trending where prices start to increase as confidence builds (or the
                opposite); distribution where informed participants sell off while
                others continue to buy (or the opposite) following the trend.<br>
                - A trend will persist until there is evidence to the contrary.<br>
                - Averages from different indices must give similar indications (a
                single indicator is not enough).<br>
                - Volumes must confirm the trend - i.e. they should be expanding in
                the direction of the existing trend. Volumes are expected
                to decrease near the end of a consolidation period - any traders
                that wanted to buy or sell assets would have done so by then.<br><br>

                It follows that a key part of technical analysis is identifying
                trends. Typically a trend may be established as long as price
                remains below (if trending up) or above (if trending down) an
                indicator.<br>
                Trendlines can provide support/resistance levels for the price.
                The more times these levels have been tested, the more reliable
                the trend. The same applies if the trend has persisted for a
                long period, or has a sufficiently high (but not too high!) slope.<br><br>

                Oscillations around the trend can be quite normal, however
                if these are seen to converge to a price this might be an indication
                that the trend is near its end. Furthermore bar ranges can be
                indicative of a trend end. A relevant example is the bar stochastic
                index (defined as the ratio between \((C-L)/(H-L)\)) which indicates
                ends of trend on decline.<br>
            </p>

            <div class='mark'>
                To some extent the validity of the above observations around trends
                presuppose that similar signals/patterns are followed by a
                sufficient number of traders. The latter presumably would set
                their buy/sell orders based on signals similar to the above. If
                that changes these may no longer be valid indicators.

            </div>

            <h2> Moving averages </h2>
            <p> First and foremost moving averages may be used as a price filter
                (filtering out short term volatility) that gives a clearer
                indication of price activity. The key relevant parameters are:<br>
                - length: shorter lengths will be more volatile and indicative
                of shorter term trends. <br>
                - calculation method: this may be as simple as averaging values
                equally weighted or more complicated, e.g. using an exponential
                moving average, or different weights when averaging
                (e.g. based on volumes). <br>
                - time displacement: the moving average may be displaced backwards
                or forwards to change the way it aligns with the data; this can
                affect how reliably it can be used as a support/resistance line.<br>
                - degree of smoothing: the moving average time-series could be
                averaged a second time to further remove volatility. <br><br>

                A moving average if appropriately tuned may serve as a
                support/resistance level, e.g. the 26 day average on the figure.
                The points where it crosses the prices may be considered
                as entry/exit points.<br>
                Alternatively, a point where a short term moving average crosses above
                a long term moving average may be considered as a reasonable
                entry (buy) point. The opposite applies for exit (sell) points.
                Commonly used values (apart from the 12/26 day shown on the
                example) are 50 and 100 day moving averages.<br>
                Taking the difference between the 12 and 26 day variables,
                effectively removes the underlying trend and results to an
                oscillator - negative on downward trends and positive on upward
                trends. This particular oscillator is named MACD (Moving
                Average Convergence Divergence) indicator. Taking the moving
                average of the oscillator gives a signal line which indicates
                entry and exit points when it crosses the MACD line. Note that
                these points come earlier than the ones indicated by the
                crossing of the averages.<br>

                <iframe class='img' src="figures/algo_technicalAnalysis_volumes.html"></iframe>
            </div>

            <h2> Volume </h2>
            <p> Volume (in numbers of stocks traded) is indicative of market
                participation or interest in a specific asset. It can confirm the
                trend if expanding in the direction of the trend. In cases of
                consolidation, volume at historic low values may precede a breakout.<br>
                Volume levels can related to bar range: high volumes and ranges
                indicating continuation; low volume and ranges resting levels;
                and any other combination a potential reversal.
                Filtering volume via e.g. a moving average or based on recent
                peaks can give a clearer picture of volume trends and help
                identify entry/exit points.<br><br>

                In addition, there are a number of oscillators based on volume.
                One is OBV (On Balance Volume) which is simply the cumulative
                sum of volumes over the examined period multiplied by:
                \[mul= 1 if C>C-1 else -1 if C-1>C\]
                This indicator is expected to increase in the direction of the
                trend, with too high/low levels indicating possible reversal.<br>
                Another indicator is ADL (Accumulation Distribution Line) which
                again is a cumulative sum of volumes multiplied by:
                \[mul = (2\cdot C-L-H)/(H-L)\]
                Compared to OBV this incorporates price movements in the
                calculation and is indicative of how strong buying or selling
                action is. ADL trend should match the price trend.<br>
