          <h1> Background info </h1>
          <p> There are three main approaches on could adopt to forecast prices and
          subsequently trade in the market.<br>
          The first is fundamental analysis, where one attempts to identify the
          intrinsic value of the investment through analysis of past company
          financials (or commodity demand).<br>
          The second is technical analysis, where one attempts to predict
          market dynamics based on past historic price patterns. Alternatively,
          through quantitative analysis - by applying more rigorous mathematical
          analysis on historical data, including assessing technical analysis
          approaches and their performance - it is possible to come up with
          trading methods with a certain degree of success.
          Finally, one may follow publicly available information and news to
          form an idea about how the market is expected to move.<br> </p>

        <div class='note'>
            <h2> Technical analysis rationale </h2>
            <p> The reasoning behind technical analysis is that there are
            inefficiencies which do not allow the market to perfectly discount
            available information about an asset's value. For example, there
            might be some insider activity that could start affecting an asset's
            price even before news break out. Furthermore, even when all news
            become available not all market participants will act at the same
            moment, while there might also be some momentum that results in the
            asset's price being much lower or higher than it is actually worth.<br><br>

            Technical analysis is based on the Dow theory which assumes that:<br>
            - The averages (market trend) will eventually discount everything<br>
            - There are three key trends in the market: a primary one which can
            last months to years; a secondary reaction which lasts weeks to
            months; and minor trends which last days to weeks.<br>
            - Primary trends have three phases: accumulation where informed
            participants buy more of the asset while others being bearish sell;
            trending where prices start to increase as confidence builds (or the
            opposite); distribution where informed participants sell off while
            others continue to buy (or the opposite) following the trend.<br>
            - A trend will persist until there is evidence to the contrary.<br>
            - Averages from different indices must give similar indications (a
            single indicator is not enough).<br>
            - Volumes must confirm the trend - i.e. they should be expancing in
            the direction of the existing trend.<br>
