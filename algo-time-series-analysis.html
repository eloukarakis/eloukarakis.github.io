          <h1> What's this about? </h1>
          <p> Excluding more complicated machine-learning algorithms, there's a
              whole bunch of more basic, statistical approaches to forecasting.
              Many of those involve using just the time-series itself rather than
              a large number of relevant features, and a relatively low
              computational cost.

            <h2> (Moving) averages </h2>
            <p> The mean value of a time-series can often provide a very basic
                forecast, at least as long as the data is stationary and
                variance remains constant. The next best thing however when the
                time-series contains an underlying trend/seasonality can be a
                moving average:
                \[ f_{t+1}=1/k\cdot\Sigma_{t-k+1}^{t}y_t \]
                A moving average will always tend to lag the time-series.<br>
                While as a forecast this might not be necessarily be the best
                that can be, it can capture trends - useful for
                building decomposition models.
