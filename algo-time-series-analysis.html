          <h1> What's this about? </h1>
          <p> Excluding more complicated machine-learning algorithms, there's a
              whole bunch of more basic, statistical approaches to forecasting.
              Many of those involve using just the time-series itself rather than
              a large number of relevant features, and a relatively low
              computational cost.

            <h2> (Moving) averages & exponential smoothing </h2>
            <p> The mean value of a time-series can often provide a very basic
                forecast, at least as long as the data is stationary and
                variance remains constant. The next best thing however when the
                time-series contains an underlying trend/seasonality can be a
                moving average:
                \[ f_{t+1}=1/k\cdot\Sigma_{t-k+1}^{t}y_t \]
                Where \(f_t\) is the forecast value and \(y_t\) the actual.
                A moving average will always tend to lag the time-series.<br>
                While as a forecast this might not be necessarily be the best
                that can be, it can capture trends - useful for
                building decomposition models.<br><br>

                More complex averaging methods are possible by adding weights
                to each value used. If these weights were set to increase
                exponentially towards the most recent value, then we have the
                exponential smoothing method. Instead of a more complex averaging
                equation we simply have (it is equivalent):
                \[ f_{t+1}=f_{t} + \alpha \cdot (y_t - f_t) \]
                Where \(\alpha\) is a parameter. Effectively each future forecast
                is adjusted by the latest known error.
