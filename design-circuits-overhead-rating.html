          <h1> Current rating of overhead circuits </h1>

	        Current flow through an electric circuit leads to energy losses which in turn
          can result in increased conductor temperature. Excessive temperatures
          may lead to a number of issues:<br>
			    - conductor annealing (heating then slow cooling of the conductor metal) which
          can result in reduced tensile strength<br>
			    - grease (which serves as an anti-corrosion or anti-wear element) may flow
           and exude from the conductor at temperatures in excess of 80C;<br>
			    - high resistance connections may fail;<br>
			    - increased conductor sag which might lead to insufficient clearance
          to ground or obstacles (e.g. trees).<br>

          <div class='mark'>
              Current rating is a value of current that the circuit may safely
              carry under typical operating conditions, so that the
              probability of conductor failure is sufficently low.
          </div>

          A very low value ensures that there won't be any temperature issues,
          but can be very costly as more circuits may be needed to serve a
          given load.<br>
          Depending on the shape of the load throughout the day a different
          rating may apply e.g. circuits supplying industrial (constant) loads
          often have their default rating scaled down. Different ratings may
          also apply under different conditions, e.g. ratings for each
          conductor in a double circuit can be scaled up, reflecting the lower
          probability of a simultaneous outage during a high load and bad
          weather conditions.<br>
          Rating values for the same conductor may vary in different countries,
          as various standards make slightly different assumptions about
          some of the factors that are involved in relevant calculations.
          Most of the following discussion focuses on the UK based standards.

        <h2> Overhead circuits thermal constraints </h2>

        Under steady state conditions the heat balance equation is:
        \[ I_{DC}^2 \cdot R_{DC} = P_F + P_R - P_S \]
        Where \(I_{DC}\) the DC current in A, \(R_{DC}\) the conductor DC resistance
        in Ohm/m, \(P_F,P_R,P_S\) the forced convection heat loss, radiation
        loss and solar radiation heat gain in W/m respectively.
        The resistance varies with temperature as follows:
        \[ R_{DC} = R_{20}(1+a \cdot (T_c-20)) \]
        Where \(R_{20}\) the conductor resistance at 20C in Ohm/m, \(a\)
        the resistance temperature coefficient in 1/C, \(T_c\)
        the conductor temperature in C. Studies in UK have indicated that
        minimum wind speeds (hence convection loss) are three times greater
        (because of thermals) when there is a high level of solar radiation.
        As such, limiting conditions are typically more onerous at times
        when there is no solar radiation and wind speeds are low. Consequently,
        the solar radiation term may be omitted. The radiation loss may be calculated by:
        \[ P_R = \pi D \ E \sigma ( (T_c+273)^4 - (T_a+273)^4 )\]
        Where E the thermal emissivity of conductor surface - assumed equal
        to 0.9 for P-27 calculations (typical IEEE and CIGRE standards value
        is 0.5) - \( \sigma \) the Stefan-Boltzmann constant equal
        to \(5.7 \cdot 10^{-8} W/m^2 \), D the conductor diameter
        in m, \( T_a \) the ambient temperature in K - set to 2/20C
        for winter/summer conditions for P-27 calculations. Finally,
        the convection loss may be calculated by:
        \[ P_F = \pi k_f \cdot Nu \cdot (T_c-T_a) \]
        \[ k_f = (2.42 + 0.0035(T_c + T_a) ) \cdot 10^{-2} \]
        \[ Nu =  \begin{bmatrix} 0.55 \cdot (0.034 + 0.575 Re^{0.487}) if Re \lt 3200 \\ 0.55 \cdot (0.071) + 0.901Re^{0.715} if Re \ge 3200 \end{bmatrix} \]
        \[ Re = u \cdot D / u_f \]
        \[ u_f = (132 + 0.48(T_c + T_a)) \cdot 10^{-7} \]
        Where u is the wind speed in m/s - assumed equal to 0.5 for P-27
        calculations. Note that the conductor temperature varies from the
        core to the surface. The above equations assume a uniform
        temperature for the whole conductor. The effect of this
        assumption for most conductors is not significant. <br>

          <h2> Weather conditions </h2>

          A series of experiments were conducted over a period of three years at Leatherhead,
          UK where a conductor was placed under constant current throughout different seasons.
          It was observed that the percentage of time that the conductor exceeded the design temperature was a function of:
          \[ t_e = f(C_T) = f( \frac{I_{DC}^2 R_{DC}}{(P_F + P_R)|_{@designTemperature}}) \]
          The function f was determined based on statistical processing of measurements
          and is shown on the figure. The rating of the conductor for a give value of \(t_e \) is given by:
          \[ I = \sqrt { \frac{C_T(P_F+P_R)|_{@designTemperature}}{R_{@designTemperature}} } \]
          For a single circuit rating P-27 assumes \( t_e = 0.001% \) which corresponds to \( C_T = 0.912\).<br><br>

          Flow of AC current through the conductor will increase the resistance (due to skin effect).
          P-27 calculations are based on a range of approximate relations that convert
          AC quantities to DC, e.g. for a ZEBRA conductor:
          \[ I_{AC} = I_{DC} \cdot (1.0123 + 2.319 \cdot I_{DC} \cdot 10^{-5})^{-1} \]
          Or for a LYNX conductor:
          \[ I_{AC} = I_{DC} \cdot (1.0045 + 0.09 \cdot I_{DC} \cdot 10^{-5})^{-1} \]
          The effect on rating can be rather limited, especially for conductors with
          a cross section equal of smaller than LYNX (95mm2).<br>

      </div>

      <div class='note'>

          <h2> An example </h2>

          The following calculations apply to summer conditions for a LYNX conductor:
          \[ P_R = 3.14 \cdot 5.7 \cdot 10^{-8} \cdot 0.9 \cdot 19.5 \cdot 10^{-3} (323^4-293^4 ) = 11W/m \]
          \[ u_f = (132 + 0.48 \cdot 70) 10^{-7} = 165.6 \cdot 10^{-7} \]
          \[ Re  = 0.5 \cdot 19.5 \cdot 10^{-3}/(165.6 \cdot 10^{-7} ) = 588.8 \]
          \[ Nu  = 0.55 \cdot (0.034+0.575 \cdot 588.8^{0.487} ) = 7.0818 \]
          \[ P_F = 3.14 \cdot (2.42+0.0035 \cdot 70) 10^{-2} \cdot 7.0818 \cdot 30 = 17.8W/m \]
          \[ R_{DC} = 0.158 (1 + 0.00428 \cdot 30) = 0.178 Ohm/km \]
          \[ I_{DC} = \sqrt {0.912 \cdot (17.8+11)/(178 \cdot 10^{-6}) } = 386.3A \]
          \[ I_{AC@0.001} = 386.3 / (1.0045 + 0.09 \cdot 386.3 \cdot 10^{-6} ) = 384.6A \]
          If we opted for a higher probability of excursion (e.g. 3%) then the rating would increase to:
          \[ I_{AC@3}= \sqrt {1.170/0.912} I_{AC@0.001} = 435.6A \]
          There is a 13% increase in rated current, which is actually the relation
          between single and multi-circuit ratings in P-27.
