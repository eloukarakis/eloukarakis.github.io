                volume, date and price;
                - future contracts: standardised form of forward contracts,
                facilitated through an exchange (which handles any credit default
                risks) with a clearly defined price;
                - swaps: ...
                - European put/call: right (but no obligation) to buy/sell
                a specific volume at specific date and price;
                - American put/call: right (but no obligation) to buy/sell
                a specific volume at a specific price up to a specific date.
