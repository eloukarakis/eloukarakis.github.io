            <h1> Derivatives & risk management </h1>
            <p> Derivatives are financial products whose value depends on
                the price of a specific asset. There is a variety of derivatives:<br>
                - forward contracts: agreement to purchase/sell at specific
                volume, date and price;<br>
                - future contracts: standardised form of forward contracts,
                facilitated through an exchange (which handles any credit default
                risks) with a clearly defined price;<br>
                - swaps: ...<br>
                - European put/call: right (but no obligation) to buy/sell
                a specific volume at specific date and price;<br>
                - American put/call: right (but no obligation) to buy/sell
                a specific volume at a specific price up to a specific date.<br>

            <h2> Pricing forward contracts </h2>
            <p> It is possible to do the following:<br>
                - buy a forward contract at t=0; this results in a cashflow at t=0: -f and at t=T: \(S_T-F\)<br>
                - short the asset; cashflow at t=0: \(S_0\)<br>
                - lend the value of asset; cashflow at t=0: \(-S_0\) and at t=T: \(S_0/d(0,T)\)<br>
                Where d(0,T) is the discount factor associated with the prevailing
                lending rate.<br>
                Based on the no-arbitrage principle the value F would be set equal to \(S_T\) 
                therefore the value paid for the contract should be f=0. Consequently
                \(F=S_0/d(0,T)\)<br><br>

            <h2> Brownian motions </h2>
            <p> Brownian motion is a random process \(\{X_t:t \ge 0\}\) with drift \(\mu\)
                and volatility \(\sigma\) if for \(\Delta t>0\):
                \[X_{t+\Delta t}-X_t \sim N(\mu \cdot \Delta t, \sigma^2 \cdot \Delta t)\]
                If drift is 0, and volatility is 1 then we have a standard Brownian motion.<br>
                Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is a random process if for 
                \(t>0\) and \(W_t\) a standard Brownian motion: 
                \( X_t=e^{(\mu-\sigma^2/2) \cdot t + \sigma \cdot W_t} \). Consequently:
                \[ X_{t+\Delta t} = X_t \cdot e^{(\mu-\sigma^2/2) \cdot \Delta t 
                + \sigma \cdot (W_{t + \Delta t} - W_t)} \]
                GBM is often use to simulate stock prices. The model may be fitted to historic data
                by observing that:
                \[ ln(X_{t + \Delta t}) - ln(X_t) \sim N(\mu - 0.5 \cdot \sigma^2, 
                \sigma \cdot \Delta t^{0.5}) \]
