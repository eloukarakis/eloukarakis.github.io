          <h1> Derivatives & risk management </h1>
          <p> Derivatives are financial products whose value depends on
          the price of a specific asset.</p>

            <h2> Forward contracts </h2>
            <p> A forward contract gives the buyer the right (and obligation)
                to purchase a specified volume of an asset, at a specified time
                T and a specified price F.<br><br>

                Consider the following portfolio:<br>
                - buy a forward contract at t=0; cashflow at t=0 -f and at t=T \(S_T-F\)<br>
                - short the asset; cashflow at t=0; \(S_0\)<br>
                - lend the value of asset; cashflow at t=0 \(-S_0\) and at t=T \(S_0/d(0,T)\)<br>
                Where d(0,T) is the discount factor associated with the prevailing
                lending rate.<br>
                The value F would in principle be set equal to \(S_T\) therefore
                the value paid for the contract should be f=0. Consequently
                \(F=S_0/d(0,T)\)<br>

            <h2> Types of derivatives </h2>
            <p> There is a variety of derivatives:
                - forward contracts: agreement to purchase/sell at specific
                volume, date and price;
                - future contracts: standardised form of forward contracts,
                facilitated through an exchange (which handles any credit default
                risks) with a clearly defined price;
                - swaps: ...
                - European put/call: right (but no obligation) to buy/sell
                a specific volume at specific date and price;
                - American put/call: right (but no obligation) to buy/sell
                a specific volume at a specific price up to a specific date.
