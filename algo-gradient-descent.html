          <h1> Unconstrained optimisation & line search </h1>

          Let's assume we want to solve \(min_xf(x)\),
          where x is a vector. One generic approach for solving this problem
          is to iteratively solve instead \(min_{a>0}f(x_k+a\cdot p_k)\) - starting from a
          point \(x_k\), we first try to find a direction \(p_k\) along which the value
          of the function decreases and then a value \(a>0\) that indicates how
          far along we should move along that direction.
          Rather than computing \(a, p_k\) exactly, we are instead looking for fast approximate methods
          which would (hopefully) allow for fast convergence to the solution.
          This is the line-search approach.
          <div class='mark'>
            Gradient (or steepest) descent is the simplest line-search based approach
            for solving unconstrained optimisation problems.

        <h2> Gradient descent </h2>

        Assuming that we can calculate a derivative for the function, it would
        be reasonable to move along exactly that direction:
        \[ x_{k+1} = x_k - a \cdot \nabla f_k \]
        Iterations are stopped as soon as the derivative is below a certain
        tolerance.<br><br>
        The step size parameter may simply be set to a predetermined value. Too
        high values can lead to instability (algorithm oscillating between points
        or simply diverging), too low values can lead to very slow convergence.<br><br>
