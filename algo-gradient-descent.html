          <h1> Background info </h1>

          Let's assume we want to solve \(min_xf(x)\),
          where x is a vector. One generic approach for solving this problem
          is to iteratively solve instead \(min_{a>0}f(x_k+a\cdot p_k)\) - starting from a
          point \(x_k\), we first try to find a direction \(p_k\) along which the value
          of the function decreases and then a value \(a>0\) that indicates how
          far along we should move along that direction.
          Rather than computing \(a, p_k\) exactly, we are instead looking for fast approximate methods
          which would (hopefully) allow for fast convergence to the solution.
          This is the so called line-search approach - we are after all searching for a
          step size \(a\) along the line defined by \(p_k\).
          <div class='mark'>
            Gradient (or steepest) descent can be thought of as the simplest
            algorithm based on the line-search concept (step-size \(a\) fixed and \(p_k\) set
            equal to minus the function derivative at the point) for solving unconstrained
            optimisation problems.

        <h2> Gradient descent </h2>

        Assuming that we can calculate a derivative for the function, it would
        be reasonable to move along exactly that direction:
        <div class='algorithm'>
            GRADIENT DESCENT<br><br>
            (0) Set \(a>0\) <br>
            (1) Set \( x_{k+1} = x_k - a_k \cdot \nabla f_k \) <br>
            (2) If \( |x_{k+1} - x_k|<\epsilon \) stop <br>
        </div>
        Iterations are stopped as soon as the derivative is below a certain
        tolerance.<br><br>

        The step size parameter may simply be set to a predetermined value. Too
        high values can lead to instability (algorithm oscillating between points
        or simply diverging), too low values can lead to very slow convergence.<br>
        A work-around to this is to introduce an inner iteration loop in
        the algorithm:
        <div class='algorithm'>
            BACKTRACKING LINE-SEARCH<br><br>
            (0) Set \( a = a_0, \rho \in (0,1), c \in (0,1) \)<br>
            (1) Check if
            \( f(x_k+a\cdot p_k) \le f(x_k) + c \cdot a \nabla f_k^T \cdot p_k \) <br>
            (2a) If true then \( a = \rho \cdot a \)<br>
            (2b) ... else stop and set \( a_k = a \)
        </div>

        For non-convex functions the algorithm is likely to converge to a
        local minimum rather than the global one.<br>

        For non-smooth functions, or for problems where the function is not
        kwown (rather a set of discrete points / observations is provided) a
        closed-form derivative would not be available and an approximation
        would be required.<br>
