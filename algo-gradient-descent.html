          <h1> Background info </h1>
          <p> Let's assume we want to solve \(min_xf(x)\),
          where x is a vector. One generic approach for solving this problem
          is to iteratively solve instead \(min_{a>0}f(x_k+a\cdot p_k)\) - starting from a
          point \(x_k\), we first try to find a direction \(p_k\) along which the value
          of the function decreases and then a value \(a>0\) that indicates how
          far along we should move along that direction.
          Rather than computing \(a, p_k\) exactly, we are instead looking for fast approximate methods
          which would (hopefully) allow for fast convergence to the solution.
          This is the so called line-search approach - we are after all searching for a
          step size \(a\) along the line defined by \(p_k\).</p>
          <div class='mark'>
            Gradient (or steepest) descent can be thought of as the simplest
            algorithm based on the line-search concept (step-size \(a\) fixed and \(p_k\) set
            equal to minus the function derivative at the point) for solving unconstrained
            optimisation problems.

            <h2> Gradient descent </h2>
            <p> Assuming that we can calculate a derivative for the function, it would
            be reasonable to move along exactly that direction: </p>

                GRADIENT DESCENT<br><br>
                (0) Set \(a>0\) <br>
                (1) Set \( x_{k+1} = x_k - a_k \cdot \nabla f_k \) <br>
                (2) If \( |x_{k+1} - x_k|<\epsilon \) stop <br>
            </div>
            <p> Iterations are stopped as soon as the derivative is below a certain
            tolerance.<br><br>

            The step size parameter may simply be set to a predetermined value. Too
            high values can lead to instability (algorithm oscillating between points
            or simply diverging), too low values can lead to very slow convergence.<br>
            A work-around to this is to introduce an inner iteration loop in
            the algorithm: </p>
            <div class='algorithm'>
                BACKTRACKING LINE-SEARCH<br><br>
                (0) Set \( a = a_0, \rho \in (0,1), c \in (0,1) \)<br>
                (1) Check if
                \( f(x_k+a\cdot p_k) \le f(x_k) + c \cdot a \nabla f_k^T \cdot p_k \) <br>
                (2a) If true then \( a = \rho \cdot a \)<br>
                (2b) ... else stop and set \( a_k = a \)
            </div>
            <p> For non-convex functions the algorithm is likely to converge to a
            local minimum rather than the global one.<br>

            For non-smooth functions, or for problems where the function is not
            kwown (rather a set of discrete points / observations is provided) a
            closed-form derivative would not be available and an approximation
            would be required.<br></p>

            <h2> Variants </h2>
            <p> One possible use of gradient descent is fitting a function
            (e.g. linear) over a dataset. In this case we are typically trying to
            minimise the errors between the function and points in the dataset.
            The partial derivatives of the parameters we are fitting are
            dependent on the errors of all points in the dataset and we could
            do the calculations accordingly. This approach where we use the
            complete dataset at each iteration is <b>batch gradient
            descent</b>.<br><br>

            In cases where the dataset is significantly large however, such
            computations might take significant time. An alternative would be
            to pick a single point int the data-set at random and carry the
            iteration based only on that - consequently derivative calculations
            can be  much faster. This approach is called <b>stochastic gradient
            descent</b>.<br><br>

            Stochastic gradient descent is unlikely to converge with the same
            accuracy as batch gradient descent to the optimal parameters and
            the convergence will not be as smooth, but it can be much
            faster for large data-sets. A compromise between the two approaches
            can be the so-called <b>mini-batch gradient descent</b> where a
            randomly selected subset of the available data is used at each
            iteration.<br></p>
