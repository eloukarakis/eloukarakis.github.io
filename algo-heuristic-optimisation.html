    <title> Heuristic optimisation </title>

    <body>

      	<div class='note'>
          <h1> Why heuristics </h1>
          <p> Consider a strongly non-convex function with several local minima,
              or one where calculating its derivatives is rather complicated.
              In such cases methods that test a broad range of feasible points
              can give better and/or faster results that a numerical optimisation
              approach. A common use cases is fine-tuning parameters in a model,
              either during the design of an actual physical system or for
              hypermeter optimisation in machine-learning pipelines.
          </p>

            <h2> Grid search </h2>
            <p> This is perhaps one of the simplest possible heuristics where
                we discretise the search space and evaluate all points defined
                in our grid. We keep the best of those points as the optimum.<br>
                Instead of keeping that last point we could repeat the grid
                search at a finer granularity around it, to further refine the
                solution.<br><br>
            </p>

            <div class='mark'>
              Grid search quite often will end up being a rather exhaustive
              search of the feasible solution space. Depending on the number of
              parameters and the time it takes to evaluate one solution, its
              application might not be possible.
            </div>

            <p> Another option is random search, where points in the feasible
                solutions space are randomly selected. With a bit of luck one
                can get quite quickly a reasonably good solution to the problem.
