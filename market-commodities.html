          <h1> Commodities for the energy market </h1>
          <p> The following provides a quick overview of key fuels and
          carbon emmissions which affect energy prices.</p>
          </div>

	    </div>

        <div class='note'>
            <h2> Oil </h2>
            <p> Crude (unrefined) oil prices vary based on oil characteristics
                (e.g. API gravity and sulphur content). Then different prices apply
                to individual refined products which would be further affected by
                refinery capacity. Transportation also plays a role with indexed
                values in different markets being quoted with (CIF - cost, insurance
                and freight) and without such costs (FOB - free on board). Different
                reference indices for different markets are e.g. calculated by
                S&P Global. However not all markets may be liquid enough.
                Two key indices used as a benchmark for oil prices across the
                world are Brent Crude Oil and WTI. The latter is calculated by
                NYMEX and refers to the price of oil produced in Texas, Louisiana
                and North Dakota. This index is representative of US oil prices and
                given that oil is produced on land, it is subject to local pipeline
                constraints. On the other hand, Brent Crude calculated by ICE and
                is based on oil refers to price for oil produced in the North Sea.
                Given that this is directly transported by cargo ships around the
                world, the index is not particularly affected by relevant
                limitations and is a better indicator for world oil prices. In
                general the two indices are closely correlated and at similar
                price levels.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='note'>
            <h2> Coal </h2>
            <p> Similar to oil, prices can vary depending on the calorific
                content of coal. Transportation costs are also a significant
                part of the final cost of fuel - power generating stations with
                a captive coal mine can have significantly lower and relatively
                constant costs compared to other more remote stations. There is
                some correlation between coal and oil prices, as coal extraction
                can be a quite oil-consuming process. Gas prices have a greater
                variation for different countries. <br>
                For Europe indicative of prices is an ARA benchmark (e.g. API2
                calculated by Argus), which refers to coal shipped to North West
                Europe in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp.
                For Australia the most important trading hub for coal is the
                port of Newcastle and is the benchmark price for the Asia region
                as well as indicating the export price from Australia itself.
                Although Newcastle represents Australian exports, this means it
                will also be relevant to internal markets due to competition.</p>

        <div class='note'>
            <h2> Gas </h2>
            <p> Trading activity is generally centred around a number of prominent
            trading hubs including: Henry (located in North America, Erath, LA);
            NBP or national balancing point (a virtual hub covering UK and
            relevant to EU as well).
            ICE offers futures contracts based on NBP. LNG transports among
            different countries can affect local prices as well.<br><br>

            Eastern AU is a large exporter of gas, with about 70% of the volumes
            produced exported as LNG - with the local demand competing with
            overseas demand. As such AU gas prices are expected to be correlated
            with international gas prices. Note that the majority of
            gas (80-90%) is traded bilaterally outside spot markets - the latter
            are mainly used by market participants to correct their trading
            position. There are multiple gas spot markets in Australia:<br>
            There is the Victoria wholesale gas market - this is a gross pool
            market (all dispatched volumes pass through this market) with a
            market carriage structure (pipeline owners make their pipelines
            available to the market operator who also schedules gas transfers).
            As such Victoria market includes costs for both the gas and the
            local transportation and delivery of the fuel.<br>
            Three Short Term Trading Markets (STTM) in Adelaide, Brisbane and
            Sydney (gross pool as well). These are contract carriage markets
            which implies that capacity is traded separately to gas. They allow
            trading on a day-ahead basis, but prices can be quite volatile
            reflecting short term developments / imbalances in the market
            and are not indicative of prices struck under confidential
            bilateral contracts.<br>
            Gas Supply hubs (GSH) at Wallumbilla (west Qld) and Moomba (north SA)
            is for further trade of upstream gas through a bid and offer
            trading platform. Participation in these markets is voluntary
            and parties may trade bilaterally outside of the market - contracts
            still have to be lodged through the hubs for settlement.<br> <p>
        </div>

        <div class='note'>
            <h2> Hydrogen </h2>
            <p> Although there is not an established (spot or futures) market for
            hydrogen yet, it is one of the key fuels considered in future energy
            scenarions. Hydrogen may be produced using fossil fuels (gas, oil
            or coal) or electricity (e.g. via electrolysis). It's potential uses
            include transport, heating and electrical power generation. It may
            be stored as compressed gas or in liquid form (through refrigeration
            down to 20K).<br>
            Hydrogen may be thought of a storage option for energy, competing
            with mechanical or electrochemical (battery) storage options.
            Renewable energy sources could be used to generate hydrogen at times
            when they cannot be fully absorbed by demand. Then the generated fuel
            may be stored or transferred via pipelines (or mixed into the gas
            existing network - up to 10% ratio). Use of fossil fuels combined
            with carbon capture technologies is also a viable option for
            hydrogen generation.</p>

        <div class='note'>
            <h2> Carbon emmisions </h2>
            <p> Not really a fuel but still tradeable.
            The Kyoto Protocol commits developed countries to individual
            legally binding targets to limit or reduce greenhouse gas
            emissions. Each individual country can determine the tools they
            will use to achieve their individual target. The EU participated
            as whole and created EU ETS (Emissions Trading System). Under this
            system, a total cap for CO2 emissions is defined, then allowances
            for emissions (EUAs) are distributed in each member state. EUAs
            (that’s an allowance to emit 1tn of CO2 during a specified period)
            can be freely traded across EU by the involved
            industries / companies. Each year, each company has to report its
            actual emissions by end of March and surrender a number of allowances
            for those emissions. Otherwise a penalty has to be paid -
            which however does not waive the
            obligation to submit the missing allowances. <br>
            Specifically for UK, following Brexit the EU ETS was replaced by a
            UK ETS and UK allowances (UKA). While the two schemes were linked
            initially this is no longer the case. Australia on the other hand does not
            currently have an established market.<br></p>
