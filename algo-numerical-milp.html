    <title> Mixed integer linear programming </title>

    <body>

      	<div class='note'>
          <h1> Background info </h1>
          <p> The typical mixed integer problem may be written as follows:
              \[min\{cx + hy\}\]
              \[A \cdot x  + G \cdot y \le b\]
              \[x \ge 0\]
              \[y \ge 0\]
              Where x is integral, while y a continuous variables vector.
              The two most successful algorithms that may be used to solve MILPs are: 
              a) branch-and-bound; b) cutting plane method. Both leverage the fact that we
              can solve efficiently linear programming problems.<br>

            <h2> Branch-and-bound method</h2>
            <p> This approach involves the following steps
            </p>
            <div class='algorithm'>
                BRANCH-AND-BOUND<br><br>
                (0) Define a set \(L\) containing a single node with the LP relaxation of
                the original MILP problem.<br>
                (1) (node selection) Pick a node from the set \(L\) and remove it from the set.
                If the set is empty the algorithm has converged.<br>
                (2) (prune) Solve the associated problem. If it is infeasible go back to (1).
                If it is MILP feasible store and the objective function is lower than the best
                known solution, replace the later and go back to (1).<br>
                (3) (branch) Construct at least 2 linear programs with smaller feasible regions,
                such that the optimal (non-integer) solution to the problem is excluded, and go
                back to step (1).
            </div>

            Key factors that affect the speed of convergence is the node selection and branching
            processes, as well as the quality of any known solutions to the MILP.
