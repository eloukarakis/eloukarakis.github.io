          <h1> Procuring response </h1>
          <p> Depending on system conditions the system operator would require
              varying amounts of spinning / operating reserve (i.e. generation
              that automatically adjusts output based on frequency). The response
              requirement is likely to depend on demand levels, large power station
              availability shortfalls, the greater of the largest secured loss of
              generation or loss of import from interconnections.<br><br>
              Market participants may be able to fulfill these requirements, but
              their speed of response is dependent on their equipment. A battery
              (electrochemical reactions and associated power electronics are
              fast) can respond much faster than a conventional generator (burning
              more fuel and the electromechanical parts of the controls can be
              slow); an industrial load operated via a switch cannot follow
              frequency continuously (can just switch off when frequency drops
              below a predefined value).<br><br>
              To facilitate participation while clearly identifying resource
              capability a number of frequency response markets/products with
              clearly specified characteristics (e.g. response times, metering
              requirements) are made available. While the underlying principles
              are always the same, these products differ from country to country.
              Furthermore clearing  and frequency of the market may also vary.

            <h2> United Kingdom (National Grid) </h2>
            <p> The total requirement up to 2020 has been procured through two
                separate mechanisms: Mandatory Frequency Response (MFR) and
                Firm Frequency Response (FFR). The frequency response markets
                trade in 4 products:<br>
                - Primary dynamic response (droop control, provided within 10seconds for 20sec);<br>
                - Secondary static response (switched action, provided within 30sec for 30min);<br>
                - Secondary dynamic response (droop control, provided within 30sec for 30min);<br>
                - High dynamic response (droop control, provided within 10sec indefinitely).<br>

                For FFR, these products are bought through competitive pay-as-bid tenders.
                FFR bids are in combinations of EFA blocks (4 hours time-blocks, 6 per day)
                with an availability fee (£/MWh). The most cost effective bids
                and alternative actions (including response available through MFR)
                combination that could cover the response requirement is procured.<br><br>

                For MFR, generators (depending on size) may be obliged to have the
                capability to provide the service. Generators submit prices each month
                for availability (£/h) and are dispatched daily as the system state
                requires. Generators receive a holding payment (£/h) based on
                their submitted prices for the hours instructed to provide the service,
                as well as a response energy payment (£/MWh) which is linked to
                the Balancing Market clearing price.<br><br>

                From 2021 onwards there is an ongoing effort to move all markets
                closer to real-time and further standardise products in to three
                core categories:<br>
                - Dynamic Regulation<br>
                - Dynamic Moderation<br>
                - Dynamic Containment<br>
                These are all droop control based with varying curves. Currently
                these are paid-as-cleared markets, run a day-ahead. Service
                providers are paid an availability fee (£/MWh).<br><br>

                Equipment operational limitations have to be accounted for by
                the service providers - e.g. providing response through a storage
                device may lead to the available energy being depleted.
                In that case the service provider may withhold a fraction of the
                battery capacity to allow some (limited) state-of-charge management.
                Alternatively, the battery may be used as part of a wider portfolio,
                with other assets substituting the battery if there is insufficient
                state-of-charge to provide the service.

            <h2> Australia (AEMO) </h2>
            <p> As of 2022 AEMO procures the required services
                through their dispatch mechanism, in 5-min intervals. The response
                or FCAS (Frequency Response Ancillary Services) market trades
                in the following 8 products:<br>
                - Regulation Raise/Lower (real-time frequency control dispatched
                at the instruction of the system operator)<br>
                - Fast Raise/Lower (response in 6 seconds based on droop or
                static controls, 60 seconds duration)<br>
                - Slow Raise/Lower (response in 60 seconds, 5 minutes duration)<br>
                - Delayed Raise/Lower (response in 5 minutes, 10 minutes duration)<br><br>

                Participants submit an availability price ($/MWh). The FCAS
                market is cooptimised with the spot (balancing) market and is
                paid-as-cleared.<br><br>

                However recent reviews indicate a gradual deterioration of
                frequency response under normal operating conditions. Main cause
                being that older generators which traditionally provided by
                default frequency response no longer do so (increasing control
                deadbands or removing any response as they upgrade older
                controllers to digital) as there is no regulation that enforces
                them to. AEMO is currently proposing reinstating a mandatory
                frequency response requirement from conventional generation.<br>
